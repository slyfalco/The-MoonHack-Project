# The MoonHack Project

I have made an interactable menu for everything that is in ephem in a date word format, this can automatically detect your location and timezone and you can also enter in your own location, same for the date and accounts for leap years. You can also save the information to a file.

I used these data libraries: time, datetime, os, gc, pytz, ephem, wmi, geocoder, timezonefinder, geopy and backports.zoneinfo

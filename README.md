# The MoonHack Project

## **Introduction:**

This Python project calculates the time every planet rises and sets in our solar system based on longitude, latitude and timezone.

It can automatically use geolocation to locate your longitude, latitude and timezone, and you can specify the date. This project also checks if cmd is running.
